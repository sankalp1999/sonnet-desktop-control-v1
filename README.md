Hacky code (don't judge me)

I tried to control my desktop yesterday with help of 3.5 sonnet (and failed mostly). i use three function calls - take a screenshot to analyze screen, move cursor and click and one to type text.

sonnet vision is very good but still misses buttons by a small margin

`git clone https://github.com/sankalp1999/sonnet-desktop-control-v1.git`

`python -m venv myenv`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
